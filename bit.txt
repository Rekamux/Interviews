Count ones in c:

for( int i = c; i != 0; i &= i - 1 ) count++;

Show all the differences between a and b:  a^b

Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
public int singleNumber(int[] A) 
{
	int x = 0;
	for (int a : A) {
		x = x ^ a;
	}
	return x;
}

Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. Find that single one.
public int singleNumber(int[] A) {
    int ones = 0, twos = 0, threes = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
        twos |= ones & A[i];
        ones ^= A[i];
        threes = ones & twos;
        ones &= ~threes;
        twos &= ~threes;
    }
    return ones;
}

public int swapBits(int n, int i, int j) {
	int a = (n >> i) & 1;
	int b = (n >> j) & 1;
 
	if ((a ^ b) != 0) {
		return n ^= (1 << i) | (1 << j);
	}
 
	return n;
}
